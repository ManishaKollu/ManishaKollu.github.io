  <b>ABOUT ME</b></b>
  <b>My past</b>
I got graduated recently from University of North Carolina at Charlotte with a major in Information Technology. I am currently looking for a full time opportunity in my field of study. During my under graduate study I worked as a Software Engineer Intern at Coign IT Service pvt ltd back in India where in I was responsible for designing and developing an application. I have gained some professional real time experience from this opportunity. I also worked on several projects during my Master's program and my favorite part of a project is to design creative webpages.

<b>Who am I ?</b>
I am a hard working and systematic, I work with enthusiasm and commitment. I pay attention to every detail which makes it easy to find flaws. I have quick pick up skills and I am eager to learn new things from others. I also try my level best to help my peers get through tough situations.

<b>What I am looking for</b>
I am looking for a position where I can make significant contribution. I am comfortable working with technologies I have learnt and I am eager to learn new things as well. I am interested in front end positions where they deal with HTML, CSS, Javascript etc. I value culture and communication I am looking forward to work in an environment where employees have a little healthy competition and are engaged in motivating each other towards their goals. I can adapt to new places easily and I am ready to re-locate  for my job.

I can start working immediately. Please feel free to contact me through email.
